this is a small app to generate animated gifs from texts.
obstructions and backgrounds may be added and animated as well 
so these can be used as captchas.

see eppur-si.appspot.com for a demo.

this can be used as a secure (two-step) or non secure online image generation.
(the url of the first step includes the word, see that for a demo.)

it uses the 
images2gif python module. (but not all of it . - thanks to the authors of that..)

imagesH.py is uses that library and includes code for generating obfuscations for the animated captcha. 

sample usage 

in the main itself
def main():
    for aye in range(2):
        v=VISCHA('Example 32',aye,{'dx'=4,'shape'=1})
        with open('ffexample{}.gif'.format(aye),'w') as FP:
            v.writeImage_fp(FP)           


these are the possible parameters parameters.

{  'font'       : 0,
                'font_size'  : 36,
                'screen_d'   : 14,
                'screen_r'   : 16,
                'wobble'     : 0,
                'dx'         :0 ,
                'dy'          :0,
                'duration'    : 10,
                'width'      : 300,
                'height'     : 120,
                'wordCount'  : 10,
                'shape'      : 0,
                'bgColor'    : 255,
                'bgwColor'   : 100,
                'screenColor': 155,
                'fgColor'    : 100 },
             

muove.py contains the google app code that receives the requests as described in the appspot page , and dispatches the right calls.

this is setup to work with google app engine.
